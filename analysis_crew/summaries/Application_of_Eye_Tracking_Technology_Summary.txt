This systematic review by Daniel Martinez-Marquez and colleagues examines the application of eye tracking technology in high-risk industries such as aviation, maritime, and construction. The review highlights that most accidents in these sectors are due to human error, often linked to impaired mental performance and attention failure. Eye tracking research, dating back 150 years, captures a variety of eye movements that reflect human cognitive, emotional, and physiological states, providing insights into the human mind in different scenarios.

The review identifies the demographic distribution and applications of eye tracking research, revealing that the aviation industry has the highest number of studies, followed by maritime and construction. The USA leads in eye tracking studies, with significant contributions from Germany, Norway, China, and the UK. The research uncovers different applications of eye tracking, such as studying visual attention, mental workload, human-machine interfaces, situation awareness, training improvement, and hazard identification.

Eye tracking technologies are often integrated with simulators, video and audio recording, head trackers, EEG, ECG, and other technologies to study various human aspects in detail. The review identifies gaps in the literature, suggesting the need for further research on topics like mental workload in construction, hazard detection in aviation and maritime, and the integration of additional technologies to support eye tracking research. The study concludes that eye tracking has a promising future in enhancing understanding and training in high-risk industries.
