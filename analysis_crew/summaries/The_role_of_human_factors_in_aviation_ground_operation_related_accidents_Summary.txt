The study, published in Transportation Engineering 13 (2023), examines the role of human factors in aviation ground operation-related accidents and incidents using a human error analysis approach. The research analyzed 87 accident and incident reports from 2000 to 2020, employing the Human Factors Dirty Dozen (HF DD) Model and the Human Factors Analysis and Classification Scheme (HFACS) for systematic thematic analysis. The findings highlight that the main causes of ground operation-related accidents and incidents are lack of situational awareness and failure to follow prescribed procedures. Critical operational actions identified include aircraft pushback/towing, aircraft arrival and departure, and aircraft weight and balance. The study proposes an agenda for future research and recommendations for industry corrective action, emphasizing the need for a comprehensive Ramp Resource Management (RRM) framework to address the identified safety issues. The research also suggests that current human error analysis models may need to be extended to consider the broader organization and aviation system context.
