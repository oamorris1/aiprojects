The Denver Zoological Foundation provides information on the African lion (Panthera leo melanochaita), a vulnerable species primarily found in sub-Saharan Africa's savannas, grasslands, and woodlands. Classified as a mammal within the order Carnivora and the family Felidae, lions are the second-largest big cat species, with males larger than females and possessing distinctive manes. They are social animals, living in prides and exhibiting communal hunting and parenting behaviors. Lions are carnivorous, preying on various ungulates and scavenging when necessary. In captivity, their diet is carefully managed with nutrient-fortified meat and occasional fasting.

Lions have several adaptations for survival, including group behavior, night vision, and powerful bodies with retractable claws for hunting. They are apex and keystone predators, with roars that can be heard up to 5 miles away. The Denver Zoo houses a coalition of four male lions born in 2015 and a pride with several females and a male cub born in 2019. The lions' conservation status is vulnerable due to habitat loss and human conflict, with an estimated 43% population reduction over 21 years, leaving around 20,000 lions in the wild. Conservation efforts focus on creating safe habitats and national parks to ensure their survival.
