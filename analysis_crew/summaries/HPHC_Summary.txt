This paper by Omar A. Morris and Khalid H. Abed from Jackson State University describes the process of configuring and administering a Cray CS 400 heterogeneous cluster using Bright Cluster Manager software. The paper outlines the steps from hardware assembly to software installation, including the OS and system management tools. The Cray CS 400 cluster consists of a head node and six compute nodes, with the compute nodes featuring Intel Xeon E5-2698 CPUs and dual Intel Xeon Phi 7120 coprocessors. The authors detail the network topology, software installation process, and the creation of a compute node image. They also discuss the installation of the Many Integrated Core (MIC) software stack necessary for the Xeon Phi coprocessors to function.

The paper further explores the use of the cluster for high-performance computing (HPC) research, specifically using the Mantevo Project's MiniMD mini-application to benchmark and compare the performance of the cluster's conventional multi-core Xeon processor against the Intel Xeon Phi architecture. The research aims to demonstrate increased speed and efficiency on the MIC hardware. The authors conclude by acknowledging the support received for the project and stating that future work will focus on detailing the cluster's performance and improving the installation and administration process.
